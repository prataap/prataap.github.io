Facebook announced Bots for Messenger in April, 2016 making it possible for developers to connect with the more than 900 million people around the world who use Messenger every month.  
  
  
### What is Bots for Messenger?  
Bots for Messenger are for anyone who's trying to reach people on mobile - no matter how big or small your company or idea is, or what problem you're trying to solve.   
Whether you're building apps or experiences to share weather updates, confirm reservations at a hotel, or send receipts from a recent purchase, bots make it possible for you to be more personal, more proactive, and more streamlined in the way that you interact with people.
